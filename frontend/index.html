                      <p>
                        Ransomware being a major threat to Vanguard, I assessed their network and  created a cloud migration plan to move 70TB of data to GCP storage bucket as a backup. Main steps of the plan: <br>
* A transfer appliance needed because the data was too large/expensive to stream. <br>
* Data parsed out to standard, coldline, and archive classes to reduce cost. <br>
* Workspace account connected to a Google Cloud Storage FUSE to access the storage bucket as a shared drive for IAM authorized staff.

                      <p>
                        

With a large company that has dozens of field contractors and 3 office locations, sharing and securing data is essential. I assessed Rye’s networks and created a cloud organizational policy plan that utilized GCP's Resource Manager. This allows for an Organization/Folder/Project structure to create groups with the least amount of privilege to each storage bucket. In some instances ACL’s were utilized to keep certain objects secure within storage buckets.
